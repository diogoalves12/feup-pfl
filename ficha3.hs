Observations:

- The first equation (base case) defines the factorial of 0
-The second equation (recursive case) defines the factorial of n using the factorial of n âˆ’ 1
    
If we start from a positive integer, the recursive case makes progress towards the base case 
Hence: factorial is defined for all non-negative integers

If we start from a negative integer, the recursive case moves away from the base case
Hence: factorial (-1) leads to non-termination

The order of the two equations matters:
    factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)
    factorial 0 = 1

The second equation is never tried, hence this version is not defined for any integer!
